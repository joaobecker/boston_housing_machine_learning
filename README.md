# Boston Housing Machine Learning

##### This project will analyze the  Boston Housing data set, which contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. We will start with an EDA to understand the variables and the correlations with price. Next, we will use Linear Regression to predict the value of the Houses.


### Results -
##### Initially, our model had an R-Square of 0.593. After running the EDA with quantile plot, fitted vs. residual plot and leverage plot, we were able to identify the outliers and improve our model to 0.743 R-Square.
